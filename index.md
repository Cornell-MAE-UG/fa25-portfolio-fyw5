## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG-7549.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hello! My name is Felicity Wu, and I am a Sophomore at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and based in New York City. Growing up, I was always drawn to creating: Whether it be drawing in my art class, building a random craft kit, or bullet journaling in my free time, I have done (and loved) it all! Through exploring these various sidequests, I have learned how powerful creativity can be in shaping the world around us. As a creative-minded individual, I am passionate about using my skills toward solving meaningful problems and contributing to society in impactful ways. 

Combining my passion for creativity and impact with my love for STEM, I discovered mechanical engineering, which is the perfect crossway that connects all my interests in a way that is meaningful to me. I am excited to further develop my professional skill set, explore opportunities to apply my knowledge to impactful projects, and grow throughout my time at Cornell.

At Cornell, I am a part of CUXR (Cornell Extended Reality), the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE), the Engineering Leadership Certification Program, and Anabel's Grocery. I have also taken courses such as Thermodynamics, Statics, Physics II: Electricity & Magnetism, Physics I: Mechanics, Differential Equations, and more!
